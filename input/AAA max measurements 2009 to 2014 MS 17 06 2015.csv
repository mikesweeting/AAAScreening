# This file contains a set of distributions for the baseline aorta diameter. 
# The first two "columns" are the sizes in centimetres. Each of pw, pwstar, 
# pwstar2, and pwstar3 is a set of weights that defines a distribution. 
# 
# The validation (men4yearsValidation.R) uses pwstar3. 
# Phase IB (ii), the analysis using the updated parameters like in Glover et 
# al 2014, uses pw, which is the NAAASP baseline distribution.    
# 
# This is produced by the Stata do-file 
# "SWAN_mixed_model_parameter_generation, slightly edited.do"
#@ 
#@ In case the file name changes: this file is currently called 
#@ "AAA max measurements 2009 to 2014 MS 17 06 2015.csv"
